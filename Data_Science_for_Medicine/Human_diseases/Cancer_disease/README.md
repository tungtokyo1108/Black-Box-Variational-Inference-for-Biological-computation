# Human colorectal cancer (CRC)

Colorectal cancer (CRC), also known as large bowel cancer, is one of the most common forms of cancer and the third most common cause of cancer
mortality in the world (Jemal et al., 2011). Although heredity is tightly associated with some forms of CRC, diet is
considered to be the most significant risk factor of this disease by many researchers. Incidence of up to 80% of CRC has been attributed to dietary factors in
western populations by epidemiological surveys (Bingham, 2000). High rates of CRC are found in populations consuming diets high in animal fat, red
meat and processed meat, and low in unrefined grains, dietary fiber and vegetables (Dahm et al., 2010)

One of the important factors associated with CRC is the intestinal microbiota. The human gastrointestinal tract harbors approximately 1000 species of bacteria
totaling 1014 cells, which is more than 10-fold the number of eukaryotic human cells (Ley et al., 2006). In addition to influencing host
nutrition via metabolism, the intestinal microbiota affects the human body by controlling epithelial proliferation and differentiation, influencing the development of the immune system and
protecting against pathogens.
