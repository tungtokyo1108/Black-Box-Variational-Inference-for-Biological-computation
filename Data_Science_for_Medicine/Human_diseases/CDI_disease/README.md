# Clostridium difficile infections (CDI)
Since the discovery of penicillin in 1928, antibiotics have revolutionized health care, saving patients from life-threatening infections, 
such as bacteremia, bacterial meningitis, tuberculosis, and pneumonia. It has recently been estimated that over 250 million courses of 
antibiotics are prescribed to outpatients in the United States annually. However, besides eradicating the pathogen of interest, 
antibiotics disturb members of the indigenous bacterial community of the gastrointestinal tract, i.e., the gut microbiome. 
In hospitals, this disruption may result in Clostridium difficile infection (CDI), the leading nosocomial infectious disease 
in the United States. Cases of CDI have more than doubled since 2001, with over 300,000 new diagnoses in 2009
